  <h1>The History of Computers and the Internet</h1>

  <hr>

  <h2>Early Computers</h2>
  <p>
    The history of computers began with <b>mechanical devices</b> such as the <strong>abacus</strong>,
    which was used for calculations thousands of years ago. In the 1800s, <u>Charles Babbage</u>
    designed the <em>Analytical Engine</em>, often referred to as the <mark>first concept of a programmable computer</mark>.
    His work laid the foundation for the modern computer.
    Ada Lovelace, his assistant, is considered the <i>first computer programmer</i>.
    Back then, <abbr title="Input/Output">I/O</abbr> operations were performed using punch cards.
    These machines had no <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> as we know them today.
    Data storage was limited and relied heavily on <del>magnetic tape</del> <ins>punch cards</ins>.

  <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
  <p>
    The development of computers is often categorized into <strong>five generations</strong>.
    The first generation used <mark>vacuum tubes</mark>, which were <small>large and unreliable</small>.
    The second generation introduced <b>transistors</b>, which made machines smaller and faster.
    The third generation brought in <i>integrated circuits</i>, and by the fourth generation,
    we saw the introduction of the <u>microprocessor</u>.
    With the fifth generation, <em>artificial intelligence</em> became a focus.
    Over time, computing power increased exponentially—an idea captured by <strong>Moore’s Law</strong>.
    For example, <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr> that once held 4KB can now hold several gigabytes.
    Mathematically, performance has improved in ways modeled by equations such as:
    <br>
    <q>E = mc<sup>2</sup></q> and H<sub>2</sub>O for water structure.

  <h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
  <p>
    The Internet began as a military research project known as <abbr title="Advanced Research Projects Agency Network">ARPANET</abbr>
    in the late 1960s. It was designed to allow multiple computers to communicate on a single network.
    In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>, which transformed the Internet into what we know today.
    Early connections used <del>dial-up</del> modems, which were slow and noisy.
    Web browsers like Netscape revolutionized access to online information.
    As Tim Berners-Lee once said:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    "The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect."
    – <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Over time, websites evolved from static pages written in <code>HTML</code> to dynamic applications powered by 
    <code>JavaScript</code>, <code>CSS</code>, and various frameworks.
    Today, we access the web using devices that are <small>thousands of times more powerful</small> than early computers.
  </p>

  <h2>Modern Era</h2>
  <p>
    In the modern era, computers have become an essential part of daily life.
    We use smartphones that are more powerful than the computers used to land on the moon.
    Technologies like <strong>cloud computing</strong>, <em>machine learning</em>, and <mark>IoT (Internet of Things)</mark>
    are shaping the future. Wearable tech, smart homes, and AI assistants are common.
    Instead of relying on floppy disks, we now use <del>DVDs</del> <ins>cloud storage</ins>.
    The speed of modern processors can be represented with expressions such as:
    <br>
    Clock Speed = Frequency (GHz) × 10<sup>9</sup>
    <br>
    Water is H<sub>2</sub>O and sulfuric acid is H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.
    We now also use terms like <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> and <abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> regularly.

  <h2>Computer Code Example</h2>
  <p>
    Here's an example of simple HTML code used to display a message on a webpage:
  </p>

  <pre>
<code>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    Another example: Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> to save your work.<br>
    System response: <samp>File saved successfull
