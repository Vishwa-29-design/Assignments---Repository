    Hello! My name is <b>Vishwa</b>.<br> I am First year student of <b>B.tech</b> at Swaminarayan University,Kalol.<br>
    I believe that understanding the basics is <mark>essential</mark> for building a strong foundation in web development.<br>
    I live in <i>Ahmedabad, Gujarat</i> and I'm passionate about technology and creativity.
  </p>

  <p>
    My hobbies include <i>reading</i>, <u>gaming</u>, <i>Coding</i>,<u>Listening Music</u> and <mark>exploring new technologies</mark>.<br>
    I also enjoy watching documentaries and learning about space—did you know that the Sun is 1.989 × 10<sup>30</sup> kg?<br>
    Sometimes I experiment with electronics and write small programs to automate tasks.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of my biggest goals is to become a <b>full-stack developer</b> in the next 2 years.<br>
    I aim to master both frontend and backend technologies, and contribute to open-source projects.<br>
    I also want to build tools that help others learn—like a quiz app that teaches HTML tags using <sub>interactive</sub> examples.
